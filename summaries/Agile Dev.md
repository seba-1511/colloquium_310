## Overview

This lecture discussed the characteristics of the agile process, extreme programming, and scrum. Waterfall is said to be too 'heavyweight' and not flexible and agile is introduced as the solution that addresses all these issues. 'Lightweight' processes were first mentioned in the 60s and 70s although the term wasn't coined until the 90s. It was originally "just for hackers" but in the mid to late 90s it boomed and culminated in big tent meeting of 'lightweights' in 2001. Jim Highsmith, an Original Manifesto signer, states that agile doesn't entirely disagree with the methodology of modelling, documentation, etc but realize that too much of it can be limiting. 

Agile guiding principles are basically specific examples of the the characterisitics.

The unifying characteristics of the agile process are: short iterations of work, incremental addition of features and capabilities, low documentation, adaptive planning, and small focused teams. It is technically not a lifecycle or a process but more of a collection of development practices and conceptual framework for other processes. The main agile processes are scrum and extreme programming although others include lean and crystal. 

## Important Slides

#### Slide n°5: 
This slide is the Agile Manifesto which states:

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

#### Slide n°20-23:
This is the slide that briefly expalins "XP - eXtreme Programming"
It was originally intended as a process but has become more of a development methodology with the belief that good practices taken to the 'extreme' will be better. It emphasizes small steps and a system that always compiles. It places the client at the center of the development team and is based on Activities, Values, and Practices.
XP Activities include coding, testing, listening, and designing and are performed within the development process. XP Values drive decisions about how to carry out the various activities and include communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. There are several XP practices including pair programming, sustainable pace, and continuous integration. XP coding enforces that a customer is always present and available, tests are written before code, optimization is saved for last, there is refactoring, and limit work schedule. XP testing emphasizes customer created acceptance tests, full coverage and tests created when bugs are found. 

#### Slide n°28-29:
These two slides describe Scrum. There's three main roles: Scrum master, Product owner, and team member. It is self-organized and teams are collocated. The key documents are the product backlog, sprint backlog, task chart, and burndown chart. The important events are Sprint Planning, Sprint, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective.
