## Overview

This lecture presents different software process models. It begins by explaining the purpose of process modeling. Then, it explains the difference between a process and a lifecycle. After discussing the problems with the waterfall method, the following processes are described: code-and-fix, prototyping, spiral development model, V-model (including dual-vee model and V with multiple deliveries), and rational unified process (RUP). Finally, it introduces the following agile development processes: lean, scrum, extreme programming (XP), and kanban.

## Important Slides

A list of the important slides, and an explanation of why they are important. (At least one slide per concept explained, easy or difficult). Please note that the number on the slide does not match up with its actual order number. The label used will be the number on the slide.

#### Slide n°4: 
Process modeling is important because it provides a common view of the process, facilitating understanding and communication. There is also automated support.

#### Slide n°5-6:
A *lifecycle* are the phases that happen in all development (on slide 6, the boxes).
A *process* is the specific steps that you do to carry out the lifecycle (on slide 6, the labels outside of the boxes).

#### Slide n°8-9:
The following are problems with the waterfall model:
* "Heavy" process, requiring a lot of paperwork and management
* Does not lend itself to change
* User requirements are fixed early
* Among others...

#### Slide n°12:
Code-and-fix is a free-for-all. There is a lack of structure.

#### Slide n°14-19:
Prototyping is used when clients don't know what they want. Prototyping should be fast and cheap. Go through iterations of prototypes for user-validation (on slide 15, the left side of the figure), then move on to the actual production (on slide 15, the right side of the figure). There are two types of prototyping: throwaway (the prototype is not carried over to production) and evolutionary (after several iterations the prototype evolves into final product). Advantages and disadvantages list opposite things (on slides 17 and 18).

#### Slide n°21:
The spiral model is iterative and risk-driven. With each revolution of the spiral, you identify the sub-problem with the highest risk and then find a solution to that problem. It's important to start with the most risky so that you can address problems as soon as possible.

#### Slide n°23:
V-model is basically the waterfall model but with a more detailed the testing phase. The different types of tests match up with the different phases that come before.

#### Slide n°24:
The dual-vee model is used for a system of systems. Each subsystem is developed using the v-model.

#### Slide n°25:
For one system, there are multiple iterations of the V-model. This allows for multiple deliveries, and at the end, the entire system is accepted.

#### Slide n°27:
The rational unified process (RUP) tries to make a new model out of the best parts of the previous models. The slide lists the six best practies. There are four phases: inception, elaboration, construction, and transition. There are nine workflows which group locical activities (focus on the ones listed on left of the figure: business modeling, requirements, analysis & design, implementation, test, deployment).

#### Slide n°31-33:
There are seven lean principles. Slides 32 and 33 define waste.

#### Slide n°34-35:
These slides describe the scrum process.

#### Slide n°36:
This slide lists characteristics of XP programming, along with drawbacks of this process.

#### Slide n°37-40:
A kanban board focuses on managing flow. It limits work-in-progress; you should complete a feature before starting a new one and the overall number of ongoing tasks is limited. Visualization allows you to keep track of what everyone is doing and can be used to find bottlenecks. Iteration and estimates are optional. For example, you can prioritize tasks.

## Exam Questions

A list of questions that will probably appear in the final exam.

* What is the difference between a process and a lifecycle?
* What are the defining characteristics of each of the different process models?
  * Prototyping
  * Spiral
  * V-Model
  * Rational Unified Process
  * Agile Development
* How are these process models different/similar to the waterfall model?
